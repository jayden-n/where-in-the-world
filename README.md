# Where-in-the-world üåç
A fully responsive web app that interacts with API to provide an in-depth look at different countries. With a color theme switcher feature and the ability to filter and search, you can easily navigate and discover new information. 

## About The Project

<p>"If you're wanting to test your JavaScript/TypeScript skills this is the challenge for you. Use whichever JS framework you prefer and pull data from the REST Countries API. 
The challenge is to integrate with the REST Countries V2 API to pull country data and display it like in the designs. You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end such as React or Vue. You also have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.
<br><br>Users should be able to:
<br>1. See all countries from the API on the homepage.
<br>
2. Search for a country using an input field.

<br>
3. Filter countries by region.

<br>
4. Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page.
<br>
5. Click through to the border countries on the detail page.
<br>
6. Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode. (Bonus)"
